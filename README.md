# penr-oz-ai-json-render-example

This repository is a minimal Next.js starter that includes the dependencies needed to render AI-generated JSON UI specs with `@json-render`.

## What is included

- Next.js + React + TypeScript skeleton.
- Dependencies for `@json-render/core` and `@json-render/react`.
- A starter page that can be wired to JSON render output.

## Run the demo

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Extend it

Replace the placeholder content in `app/page.tsx` with your JSON render integration. You can map your AI output into a JSON spec and render it using the `@json-render/react` package.
